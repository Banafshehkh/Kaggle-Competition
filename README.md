Deep Learning for Vision: Winter 2023 A3 (Image Classification)

In this competition, We used used computer vision techniques to extract meaningful features from the images and use them to classify the test images into different categories. The goal is to create a model that can accurately classify images from the testing dataset, using only the information learned from the training dataset.

This competition is mainly for the course CPSC 601: Deep Learning for Vision where I ranked 4th in the class.
